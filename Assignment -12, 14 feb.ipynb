    "##### Q1.- What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "##### Ans- Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with the help of CPU.\n",
    "##### It is a very useful technique for time-saving and improving the performance of an application. Multithreading allows the programmer to divide application tasks into sub-tasks and simultaneously run them in a program. It allows threads to communicate and share resources such as files, data, and memory to the same processorhreading module is used for creating, controlling and managing threads in python.\n",

    "###### Ans-  Python threads are used in cases where the execution of a task involves some waiting.

Threading allows python to execute other code while waiting; this is easily simulated with the sleep function.\n",

    "##### 6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "##### Ans- Deadlock:- When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock. This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others. For example, If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task.\n",
    "##### Race Conditions:- A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly. Race conditions are most commonly associated with computer science and programming. They occur when two computer program processes, or threads, attempt to access the same resource at the same time and cause problems in the system. Race conditions are considered a common issue for multithreaded applications.\n",
