    "##### Ans- Flask redirect is defined as a function or utility in Flask which allows developers to redirect users to a specified URL and assign a specified status code. When this function is called, a response object is returned, and the redirection happens to the target location with the status code. When a website is visited, server receives a request and after processing responds to the request with a three-digit code known as the HTTP code. "

    "##### Ans- emplates are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document. Flask uses the Jinja template library to render templates. In your application, you will use templates to render HTML which will display in the user's browser.\n",
    "##### It basically allows creating web applications in a Pythonic syntax and concepts. With Flask, we can use Python libraries and tools in our web applications. Using Flask we can set up a webserver to load up some basic HTML templates along with Jinja2 templating syntax"
